Aim: The aim of the practical is to write a program to construct a DFA which checks whether a the provided string satisfies a given Regular Expression or not. The following information is to be taken as the input from the user:

number of input symbols
input symbols 
number of states
initial state
Number of accepting state
The accepting state
transition table to show the transition of symbols from one state to the other

The test cases are as follows: 

a)String over 0 and 1 where every 0 is immediately followed by 11 
b)string over a,b,c starts and ends with same letter
c)string over lowercase alphabet and digits , starts with alphabet only.
